Edit: I've stopped working on this project because of the AI part. i was initially planning to use the GPT3.5-tubro API but after some testing I realized that what I wanted to do isn't possible with the GPT. 
I'm planning on continuing this project in the future by finetuning a model like Alpaca 13B to be an expert at chess and then combining that with a chess engine to have the world's first NLP Chess Engine

Chess Sensei is a project I'm currently working on. The idea behind it is to make a personal AI powered chess coach.

Here's what the current plan is: 

Functionality
- Free to use Chess analysis that's better than Chess.com
- Includes GPT and Stockfish 
    - GPT will help explain why each move is good
    - GPT will take in each move, the best move provided by stockfish, and the best move sequence provided by stockfish
    - Based on the move sequence it should be able to explain why the move is good
    - GPT will be provided with information from multiple chess books via vector databases
- “Ask the Sensei” -  Allows the user to ask GPT chess-related questions like “What's the idea behind x opening”
- Users will be able to connect their chess.com/lichess accounts but also upload game sequences
- Adaptive Puzzle Difficulty - Provide puzzles that are aimed at helping users with their specific weaknesses
- Based on their past x games they will be given suggestions on what to work on next


I'll probably add me as I countinue to develop but we'll see. 

My plan is to finish this by August but idk if that'll happen, especially if I add more stuff.
